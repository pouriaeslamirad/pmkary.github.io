<h2><small style="color:#797979;">2014</small>  Arendelle Language</h2>
[Website](http://web.arendelle.org) | [Developer Website](http://web.arendelle.org/developer/) | [GitHub Repositoriess](http://github.com/arendelle)<br>
Arendelle is a domain-specific programming language for creating 16-bit like Pixel art. Arendelle uses a grid system and a pointer for navigating and painting the desired squares of the grid. The grammar behind Arendelle is completely new as it uses only one character for it's commands and grammars. Just like everything else in Arendelle the main engine of the language is based on a new interpreter design invented by Pouya Kary named *Recursive Scanner* rather than the Lexer-Parser-Code-Generator. Using this technique the interpreter actually never generates any code. It reads the code and execute it. Like a byte-code runtime but much more powerful to understand grammars. This way for executing makes the software much more fast and efficient<br><br>

[GitHub](https://github.com/arendelle/arcco)<br>
Arcco is a port of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/) document generator monolingual for Arendelle that brings literate annotated programming and documenting culture to the Arendelle world. It's based on the Locco engine which is a port of Docco and uses Arendelle Marker as it's highlighting engine.<br><br>

[GitHub](https://github.com/arendelle/cliff)<br>
Cliff is an Arendelle code "Folder". It reads Arendelle codes and generates a folded code, It reads the code and fixes spaces sizes, code line foldings, shapes multi line comments, new lines and so.  To do this it uses the full Lexers and many other parts of Arendelle.NET to fully understand the code and shape it to be a suitable for document and webpages.<br><br>

<h2><small style="color:#797979;">2014</small>  Arcade IDE</h2>
[Website](http://web.arendelle.org/developer/) | [GitHub](http://github.com/arendelle/arendelle)<br>
Arcade IDE is the official cross-platform command line environment for Arendelle Language. It uses command line characters to represent dots (Arendelle grid's cells). Arcade is a fully cross-platform software with hard-coded operating system detection. So it runs natively on any operating system without any need for recompiling.<br><br>

<h2><small style="color:#797979;">2014</small>  Pabbie Language</h2>
[Website](http://research.arendelle.org/projects/pabbie) | [GitHub](http://github.com/arendelle/pabbie) <br>
Pabbie is language that compiles into Arendelle using a very simple and light weight source-to-source compiler. Pabbie is aimed to have a syntax and grammar close to everyday human English as a research on human language understanding and bringing programming to the people with no background on programming. The research also aims to bridge 5th generation programming languages and complex machine learning techniques to it's design to develop a language that people use to explain what they need and the system generates applications.<br><br>

<h2><small style="color:#797979;">2014</small>  Knight</h2>
[Website](http://kary.us/projects/knight) | [GitHub](http://github.com/pmkary/knight) <br>
A mathematical optimization for generating the optimized path for a Chess Knight to move from button left to the top right of a chess board with any size. The software for this algorithm is written in Arendelle Language and it's the first Arendelle software that processes a given input and generates something. Reading the code will be good for practicing data visualizations in Arendelle<br><br>

<h2><small style="color:#797979;">2013</small>  CODIUM</h2>
[GitHub](http://github.com/pmkary/codium) <br>
CODIUM is an encoding / decoding method based on prime numbers. It gives each character a prime number alternative and then by multiplying numbers of words it make a number from each word. for decoding by prime factoring the numbers you get the characters and then by running an anagram test you get the decoded version of encoded string<br><br>
