title: Notes for a Programming Language Designer
---

If you want to develop a programming language. You can do it as a small hobby or educational language. (Or you know a small implementation as a plug-in somewhere...) Or you may want to create a whole **new** programming language with many **rich** features and so. In that case these are what I found very helpful so I suggest them **highly!**:

## Books
- [How To Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language](http://createyourproglang.com/): This book is a game changer! I really mean it. Many of the great languages [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Fancy](http://www.fancy-lang.org/) and [Arendelle](http://web.arendelle.org/). The book is only 77 pages and you'll learn how to implement a universal language called Awesome at the end of it (And I agree with the name, The language is really Awesome!) Writer of the book is [Marc-André Cournoyer](http://macournoyer.com/), Mark-André is one of the kindest people I know! He's writer of [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) and [tinyrb](http://code.macournoyer.com/tinyrb/) and well too many [cool] other stuff, So you know I read many books on creating a language but this one was the one that made me go and do it! If you really wanna do it start from this book!

- [Build Your Own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com): It's a free online book that I find very much cool for a start in understanding the basics of this job. The book is designed to teach you C and Lisp by building a Lisp interpreter in C! It's a very great book! I highly suggest it to all.

- [DSL Engineering: Designing, Implementing and Using Domain-Specific Languages](http://dslbook.squarespace.com): A very very great book about "Domain Specific Languages". It covers everything from building, implementing, designing, using, embedding and so on!. It's a must for a programming language developer.
