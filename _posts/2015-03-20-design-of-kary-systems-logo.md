Today was birthday of Arendelle. Yes it's a very awesome and happy day for me. I remember how actually I invented Arendelle in this day a year ago and I had no idea what could have happened in one year of it's development which means I have no idea about how it's going to grow in the future so I guess we should wait and see. However I'm starting a company called "Kary Systems" which will work as a research lab to create awesome technologies and will have some business going. For start we want to run a program called "Julitte" that will be the base of operations for our programming learning platform based on Arendelle + Python and our own teaching process.

However designing Kary Systems has took a bit long because I want a very high quality modernism style design for it. Till now we have a prototype for our website's homepage and soon you'll be able to see it but for now I want to show you Kary System's logo... Yes! You've already seen it! Our logo is this:<br><br><br>

<br><br>The origin of this horse is me! When I was a little kid I used to draw a special kind of drawing and it used to be my horse in the drawings. Today I was searching so much for inspiration to find a nice logo for Kary Systems. I knew I wanted pure modernism like the works of Paul Rand but I had no idea what to use for the logo and just that time my father was showing my mom scans of my childhood drawings that I remembered my horse so I designed it in a computer friendly way and here it is! The Kary Systems Logo!
