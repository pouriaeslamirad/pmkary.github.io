title: Lots of resources for Language Developers
---

I love programming languages more than anything else in the computer world. Over the time I collected a resource collection for myself about compilers, interpreters, languages parsing, compiler compilers, JIT systems and so many other cool stuff that I think i't good to share them with you

## Let's do it books
You really have to start from somewhere and I strongly believe these books are great for starting:

- [How To Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language](http://createyourproglang.com/): This book is a game changer! I really mean it. Many of the great languages [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Fancy](http://www.fancy-lang.org/) and [Arendelle](http://web.arendelle.org/). The book is only 77 pages and you'll learn how to implement a universal language called Awesome at the end of it (And I agree with the name, The language is really Awesome!) Writer of the book is [Marc-André Cournoyer](http://macournoyer.com/), Mark-André is one of the kindest people I know! He's writer of [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) and [tinyrb](http://code.macournoyer.com/tinyrb/) and well too many [cool] other stuff, So you know I read many books on creating a language but this one was the one that made me go and do it! If you really wanna do it start from this book!
- [Build Your Own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com): It's a free online book that I find very much cool for a start in understanding the basics of this job. The book is designed to teach you C and Lisp by building a Lisp interpreter in C! It's a very great book! I highly suggest it to all. A very very great book about "Domain Specific Languages". It covers everything from building, implementing, designing, using, embedding and so on!. It's a must for a programming language developer.
- [How to implement a programming language in JavaScript](http://lisperator.net/pltut/): A good tutorial for the ones who wants to learn about creating a languages on their own and not using tools! Very good for all of us

## Other things that you you need
Now that you know the basics this is my whole list. There are topics from basic to really advanced stuff there. Some of this references are really short and some of them are hard and long so there is everything here
